#  Canadians Gamble More Than $4 Billion Online

Canadians love gambling, and they especially love to do it online. A recent study found that Canadians gamble more than $4 billion online every year. This is significantly more than the amount of money that Americans gamble online.

The study, which was conducted by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA), also found that Canadians are more likely to gamble on the internet than any other country in the world. In fact, almost 60% of all Canadians who gamble do so online.

So why do Canadians love to gamble online so much? The CGA believes that it has to do with the convenience and accessibility of the internet. Gamblers can access a wide variety of games and betting options from anywhere in the world, and they can do so without having to leave their home or deal with any crowds.

Another reason for the popularity of online gambling in Canada is the fact that many of the top casinos are based in Canada. These casinos offer a wide range of games and betting options, and they are always available 24/7.

Despite the popularity of online gambling in Canada, there are some risks associated with it. For example, there is always a risk of getting ripped off or losing your money to a scam artist. Additionally, there is a risk that you will lose too much money and end up in financial trouble.

If you do decide to gamble online, it is important to be aware of these risks and take steps to reduce them. You should only gamble with money that you can afford to lose, and you should never provide your personal information or banking details to anyone you don't trust.

Finally, it is important to choose a reputable casino that has a good reputation and lots of satisfied customers. The CGA provides a list of safe and reputable Canadian casinos on its website (www.canadiangamingassociation.ca).

#  Online Gambling is Now Legal in the United States

For the first time in over two decades, online gambling is now legal in the United States. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on October 15, 2018. The new law will allow casinos and other gambling entities to operate online and across state lines.

Online gambling has been a contentious issue in the United States for many years. Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a form of entertainment that should be allowed, while opponents claim that it can lead to addiction and other problems. In 2011, the Department of Justice issued a ruling that effectively made online gambling illegal.

However, the new law passed by Congress overturns that ruling. It establishes a framework for licensing and regulating online gambling operators. The law also allows states to opt out of the program if they choose. So far, only five states have opted out: Utah, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Montana.

Proponents of online gambling believe that the new law will create jobs and generate revenue for states and localities. They also argue that it will help to combat illegal gambling operations. Opponents claim that the law will lead to increased rates of problem gambling and other social ills.

#  Delaware Becomes the First State to Offer Online Gambling

On June 26, Delaware became the first state to offer online gambling. This new law allows Delaware residents to gamble on poker, blackjack, and other casino games from their home computer or smartphone.

Governor Jack Markell signed the bill into law on June 26, making Delaware the first state in the nation to offer online gambling. The bill allows residents of Delaware to gamble on poker, blackjack, and other casino games from their home computer or smartphone.

"This is an important day for our state and provides a new opportunity for Delawareans to play casino games online in a responsible and secure manner," said Governor Markell. "We worked hard to get this legislation passed because we believe it will create jobs and be a major boost to our economy."

Supporters of the bill say that it will create jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. Opponents argue that the new law will lead to more problem gambling.

#  Nevada Regulators Approve Las Vegas Casino's Use of Bitcoin for Gambling

The Nevada Gaming Control Board has approved the use of Bitcoin for gambling by the Las Vegas casino, allowing it to become the first casino in the US to allow customers to use the digital currency.

The approval was granted after a presentation by representatives from CoinSummit, who explained how Bitcoin could be used as a currency and as a way of verifying players' identities.

"This is a major event because it opens up gaming in the U.S. to Bitcoin," said Marshall Hayner, CEO of Metal Pay, one of the companies that spoke at the presentation. "It's really legitimizing Bitcoin across all industries."

The Bitcoin-based gaming system will use an app that will verify customer identities through their smartphones, eliminating the need for passwords and other personal information that can be stolen by hackers.

"One of our missions is to develop products that make it easy for people to use Bitcoin in their everyday lives," said Ryan Singer, CEO of Blockchain Infrastructure Services LLC., which helped develop the app. "This product does that by making it easier to gamble with Bitcoin."

#  U.S. Supreme Court Allows Sports Betting Nationally

On Monday, May 14th, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey and allowed states to legalize sports betting. This landmark decision overturns the 1992 Federal law that restricted sports betting to Nevada and a few other states.

This ruling is a major victory for proponents of gambling expansion and could lead to a proliferation of legal sports betting across the United States. The American Gaming Association estimates that $150 billion is illegally wagered on sports each year, so there is potential for significant growth in the industry.

The specifics of how this ruling will play out are still being ironed out, but it is likely that there will be a surge in interest in sports betting as it becomes more widely available. Sportsbooks such as DraftKings and FanDuel are likely to benefit from this ruling, and it could also open up new opportunities for casino companies such as Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International.

Investors should keep an eye on these companies as they could benefit from the legalization of sports betting. Additionally, gaming stocks may see increased volatility in the short term as the market sorts out the implications of Mondayâ€™s ruling.
