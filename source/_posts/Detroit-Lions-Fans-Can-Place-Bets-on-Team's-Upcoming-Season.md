#  Philadelphia Considers Sports Betting as Revenue Booster

Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, is considering legalizing sports betting as a way to generate new revenue for the municipality.

A report issued by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board in February showed that $50 million was wagered on sports in illegal venues in 2017. The board believes that legalizing and regulating sports betting could bring in an additional $200 million in new annual revenue. 

Mayor Jim Kenney has formed a task force to study the issue and make recommendations. The task force will include representatives from the city’s government, the casino industry, and the business community.

State Representative Vince Fumo supports legalizing sports betting and is optimistic that it will be approved this year. “I do think there’s a good chance it happens this year. There’s money to be made,” he said.

The State of New Jersey has seen significant revenue growth from legalized sports betting. In February, New Jersey casinos and racetracks took in $27.2 million in sports bets, up from $18.8 million in January. 

Critics of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and organized crime. Rick Gilliam, associate director of Ohio University’s Center for Gambling Studies, said, “If we have more access to gamble, we will have more addiction problems. It’s not rocket science.” 

Supporters of legalization argue that it can be regulated to prevent addiction and crime. They also note that it would provide much-needed revenue for municipalities and states struggling with budget deficits.

#  Detroit Lions Betting Odds released for 2016 Season

The Detroit Lions have had a busy offseason, with new additions to the team and coaching staff. As they head into training camp, the betting odds for their 2016 season have been released.

According to ESPN, the Detroit Lions are 40/1 long shots to win the Super Bowl, and they have 6/1 odds of winning the NFC North division. Their odds of making it to the playoffs are 9/2, while their odds of winning the Super Bowl are 40/1.

Some fans may be disappointed in these odds, but they are actually quite good when you consider that the team was 7-9 last year. They made some major upgrades in the offseason and have a new coaching staff that is eager to prove themselves.

Whether or not the Detroit Lions can actually make it to the Super Bowl remains to be seen, but there is no doubt that they will be a much improved team this year. So far in training camp, they have looked impressive and appear to be headed in the right direction.

#  Legal Sports Betting Could be Coming to Philly

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case that would legalize sports betting across the country. This could have a big impact on Philadelphia, which is one of the largest gambling markets in the country.

There are currently 33 states that have some form of legalized gambling, and Pennsylvania is one of them. There are 24 casinos in the state, and they bring in more than $2 billion in revenue every year.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of legalizing sports betting, that number could go up significantly. The Philadelphia area is home to 11 of those casinos, and it is projected that they would bring in an additional $500 million in revenue if sports betting were legalized.

That would be a major boon for the state and for the city of Philadelphia, which is always looking for new sources of revenue. It would also create new jobs and generate tax revenue for the government.

It's not clear how the Supreme Court will rule on this case, but there is a good chance that sports betting will be legalized across the country in the near future. That would be great news for Philadelphia, which stands to benefit from it significantly.

#  Sports Betting Begins in Philadelphia

Philadelphia, long known for its passionate sports fans, is now the home of legalized sports betting. The first casino to offer sports betting opened its doors on Thursday, September 6th. The owners of the casino are hoping that this new form of gambling will help to revive the casino’s struggling business.

The legalization of sports betting in Philadelphia has been a long time coming. In May of 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled that individual states could legalize sports betting if they chose to do so. This ruling overturned a ban on sports betting that had been in place since 1992.

Pennsylvania was one of the first states to take advantage of this ruling. In June of 2018, the state legislature passed a bill legalizing sports betting in Pennsylvania casinos. The first Pennsylvania casino to offer sports betting was the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, which began taking bets on August 15th.

Now that the first Philadelphia casino has opened its doors, it will be interesting to see how popular sports betting becomes in the city. Many people are skeptical that legalized sports betting will be successful in Philadelphia, given the city’s history of illegal gambling operations.

Illegal bookmakers have been operating in Philadelphia for many years, and they are not likely to disappear just because there is now a legal way to place bets. In fact, many of these illegal bookmakers are likely to move their operations online in order to avoid prosecution.

Despite these concerns, the owners of the new casino are optimistic about the prospects for legalized sports betting in Philadelphia. They believe that this new form of gambling will bring more people into their casino and help to revive its business. Time will tell if they are right or not.
