#  Fantasy Sports Betting is Now Legal in All 50 States

The legality of fantasy sports betting has been a topic of debate for many years. But now, as of May 14, 2018, it is officially legal in all 50 states. This makes fantasy sports betting one of the most widely available forms of gambling in the US.

This news may come as a surprise to some, as there was a lot of confusion around the legality of fantasy sports betting after the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was passed in 2006. The UIGEA made it illegal for financial institutions to process payments related to online gambling. This caused many people to believe that fantasy sports betting was also illegal. However, this act only applied to real-money gambling and did not include fantasy sports betting.

Despite its legal status, fantasy sports betting has not always been embraced by lawmakers. In fact, some states have tried to ban it. In 2016, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a cease and desist letter to FanDuel and DraftKings, the two biggest operators of fantasy sports contests at the time, accusing them of operating an illegal gambling enterprise. Schneiderman eventually backed down after losing in court, but other states have continued to try and ban fantasy sports betting.

Now that fantasy sports betting is legal in all 50 states, we can expect to see a lot more interest in this form of gambling. Many people are already familiar with it thanks to the popularity of sites like FanDuel and DraftKings. But we can expect even more people to start participating in fantasy sports contests now that it is officially legal. This could lead to even more money being wagered on these contests, which could be good news for operators like FanDuel and DraftKings.

#  Fantasy Sports Sites Win Major Victory in Legal Battle

The fantasy sports industry won a major victory in court this week, as a federal judge ruled that the industry is law-abiding and does not constitute gambling.

This ruling is a major win for the industry, which has been battling with state governments for years over whether fantasy sports constitute gambling. Fantasy sports sites have argued that their games are based on skill rather than chance, and are thus legal.

The lawsuit was brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who claimed that the industry was a form of illegal gambling. But this week’s ruling by US District Judge Colleen McMahon sided with the industry, noting that there was “no evidence that anyone has ever lost money playing Defendants’ games.”

This ruling is a major blow to Schneiderman, who has been a vocal critic of the fantasy sports industry. In a statement following the ruling, Schneiderman said that he planned to appeal the decision.

The fantasy sports industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with millions of Americans playing fantasy sports games online. The industry is worth an estimated $7 billion, and is expected to continue growing in popularity.

#  Millions of Americans to Benefit from Fantasy Sports Betting Ruling

A recent ruling by a federal judge in New York has opened up the door for widespread legalized fantasy sports betting across the United States. This ruling overturns a previous decision made in 2006 by the same judge, which banned such betting.

The new ruling is a result of a lawsuit brought by New York resident Gerard Comella, who argued that the 2006 decision was unconstitutional. The decision could lead to millions of Americans being able to place legal bets on fantasy sports contests.

According to Comella, the 2006 decision infringed on his right to free speech, as well as his right to due process. In his lawsuit, he also argued that the ban violated the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution, as it stopped fantasy sports contests from being played across state lines.

US District Judge Richard M. Berman agreed with Comella’s arguments, and issued his ruling on August 6th. The ruling declared that the 2006 decision banning fantasy sports betting was unconstitutional, and it lifted the nationwide ban on such betting.

The implications of this ruling are far-reaching, and could potentially lead to a massive expansion of the legal fantasy sports betting market. Experts estimate that the US market for legal fantasy sports betting is currently worth $150 million per year, but this figure could grow significantly following Judge Berman’s ruling.

Just how big could the market for legal fantasy sports betting become? Some industry experts believe that it could eventually reach $2 billion or more annually. This would make it one of the largest gambling markets in the United States, rivaling even traditional forms of gambling like casino games and horse racing.

It’s still too early to say for certain just how big the market for legal fantasy sports will become. However, with millions of Americans now able to place legal bets on their favorite fantasy sports teams, there’s a good chance that this market will continue to grow at a rapid pace in years to come.

#  Fantasy Sports Bets Now a Reality in Pennsylvania

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) on Thursday approved fantasy sports contests, making them the first U.S. state to do so since a May ruling by the Department of Justice that cleared the way for the popular pastime.

The Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) estimated that about 57 million people in the United States and Canada participate in fantasy sports, with most playing football, baseball or basketball.

"We are very excited to offer fantasy sports contests in Pennsylvania," said PGCB spokeswoman Nils Frederiksen. "The board believes that this product will be popular with consumers and generate additional revenue for the state."

Fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel already operate in Pennsylvania, as well as about 40 other countries. They will now be able to offer traditional betting products such as Money Line bets, point spreads, over/unders and parlays on sporting events within the state.

While both companies welcomed the news, they also cautioned that there would be some regulatory hurdles to overcome before they could fully take advantage of the new market. For example, both operators noted that they would need geolocation software to ensure players are physically located within Pennsylvania borders when they place a bet.

FanDuel pointed out that it has been working closely with regulators across the United States and looks forward to continuing those discussions in Pennsylvania. The company is also committed to ensuring that its product is safe and fun for players while creating economic opportunities for local businesses and jobs.

#  How Will the Ruling on Fantasy Sports Affect Gambling Laws?

On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of legalizing gambling on fantasy sports. This ruling overturned a previous decision made in 2006 by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled that fantasy sports betting was illegal under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was enacted in 1992 as a way to protect the integrity of sporting events. The act stipulated that it was illegal for states to legalize any form of gambling that was not already legal at the time the act was passed. In other words, states were not allowed to legalize sports betting. PASPA also stipulated that it was illegal for anyone other than state-regulated casinos to offer sports betting.

The case that resulted in this recent ruling started in 2014 when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie challenged PASPA. New Jersey argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which states that any power not specifically given to the federal government is reserved for the states. New Jersey also argued that PASPA discriminated against their state, since Nevada and three other states had been exempted from the act.

In October 2017, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey’s case. Oral arguments were heard in December 2017, and the court’s ruling was released on May 14, 2018. In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled in favor of repealing PASPA. This means that each state will now be able to decide whether or not to legalize gambling on fantasy sports.

What Does This Mean For Gambling Laws?

Now that PASPA has been repealed, each state will need to decide whether or not to legalize gambling on fantasy sports. Some states are likely to legalize gambling on fantasy sports, while others are likely to keep existing laws in place. It is also possible that some states will pass new laws regulating gambling on fantasy sports.

The effects of this ruling will likely be felt most strongly by online casinos and bookmakers. These companies have been offering odds on fantasy sports for many years, and they are likely to see a decline in business now that gambling on fantasy sports is legal in all 50 states.
