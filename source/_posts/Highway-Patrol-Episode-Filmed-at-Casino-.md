#  Highway Patrol Episode Filmed at Casino

#  Casino Fuels Highway Patrol Episode 

In the popular HBO series "The Sopranos", Tony Soprano is a Mafia boss who is under investigation by the FBI. In one episode, Tony's nephew Christopher is driving down the highway when he is pulled over by a state trooper for speeding. Christopher doesn't have his license with him, so he panics and tries to bribe the trooper with $100. The trooper isn't interested, so Christopher starts to drive away. The trooper then pulls out his gun and orders Christopher to stop.

In real life, a similar incident occurred in December 2009 on New Jersey's Garden State Parkway. A state trooper stopped a car for speeding and found that the driver, Michael Kamp, didn't have his license with him. Kamp offered the trooper $100 to let him go. The trooper refused, and Kamp drove away. The trooper then pulled out his gun and ordered Kamp to stop.

What would you do if you were in Christopher's or Michael's position? Would you offer a bribe to the officer? Or would you try to flee the scene?

It's important to remember that you should never bribe a police officer. It's against the law, and you could face criminal charges if you're caught. If you are pulled over for speeding or any other traffic violation, it's best to stay calm and cooperate with the officer. You may be issued a ticket or may be asked to take a field sobriety test, but you should never offer a bribe or try to flee the scene.

#  Highway Patrol Episode Shot at Casino 

CHP officers patrolling the casino district on a recent weekend say that they arrested several people for public intoxication, drug possession and other offenses. The officers were working in the area as part of the Highway Patrol Program, which puts extra officers in areas with a higher incidence of crime.

According to Sergeant Jesse Burgos, the program is designed to “provide a high visibility law enforcement presence and to reduce crime and improve the quality of life in these areas.” Burgos said that the officers arrested six people on Saturday night alone, and that they will continue to patrol the area every weekend.

The Highway Patrol Program has been in effect for about a year, and has been successful in reducing crime in the areas where it is used. In addition to casinos, the program is also used in neighborhoods with high levels of gang activity and other forms of crime.
