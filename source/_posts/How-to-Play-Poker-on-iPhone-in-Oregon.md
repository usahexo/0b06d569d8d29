#  Playing Poker on IMessage in Oregon

Apple has come up with a new way to play poker on your iPhone. This time, you don't have to go to an app store and download an app. You can play right from within iMessage. This is especially useful if you're in Oregon, because there are no casinos in the state.

To get started, open up iMessage and tap the 'App Store' icon. Then, scroll down until you see the 'Poker' icon. Tap it, and the game will launch right within iMessage.

The game is very easy to play. You just need to choose how many cards you want to draw, and then hit the 'Deal' button. The computer will deal out the cards, and then it's up to you to make your best hand.

If you want to bet money on the game, just type in how much you want to bet and hit the 'Bet' button. The computer will automatically move all of your money into the pot.

When you're ready to fold, just hit the 'Fold' button. This will end your turn and allow the next player to take their turn.

The goal of the game is to beat the other players by making the best hand possible. The winning hand is determined by the rank of the cards, not by the amount of money that is in the pot.

So far, I've only played a few hands of poker on iMessage, but it's already my favorite way to play poker. It's very convenient because I can play anywhere I am, as long as I have my iPhone with me.
