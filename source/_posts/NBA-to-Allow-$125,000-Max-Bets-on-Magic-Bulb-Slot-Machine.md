The Magic Bulb slot machine is a revolutionary new game that allows players to bet on virtual basketball games. The games are played by two teams of five players, each represented by a different color bulb. The object of the game is to score more points than your opponent.

Players can bet on individual games or on entire seasons. They can also bet on whether the home team or the away team will win. Bets range from $1 to $125,000.

The Magic Bulb slot machine is already a big hit in Las Vegas. Dan Singer, a casino spokesman, said that the machines are "packed all day long." He added that "the odds are good and the action is intense."

The NBA hopes that the Magic Bulb slot machine will be just as popular in other parts of the country. It plans to install machines in casinos and other gambling venues across the country.
