#  Revenue from Shogun's Land game benefits Seminole Tribe of Florida

According to a recent article by The Guardian, the American Seminole Tribe of Florida is set to receive $2.8 million from the mobile game Shogun’s Land. The game, which is produced by gaming company Kabam, is a free-to-play strategy title that has generated more than $100 million in revenue since it was launched in 2014.

Proceeds from the game will be used to benefit the tribe’s education and welfare programs. “We are grateful for Kabam’s decision to partner with us and share the wealth generated from Shogun’s Land,” said Seminole Tribe Chairman Marcellus Osceola, Jr. “This money will help us provide critical services to our community and improve the lives of our citizens.”

Shogun’s Land takes players back to feudal Japan, where they must build their own castle and train an army in order to defeat their rivals. The game has been downloaded more than 10 million times and has been featured on the App Store and Google Play several times.

Kabam Chief Operating Officer Kent Wakeford said that the company was proud to work with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and that it was committed to helping Native American communities across North America. “It is truly amazing what can be accomplished when we come together for a common cause,” he said.

The news comes at a time when the gaming industry is facing increased scrutiny from lawmakers and regulatory agencies worldwide. In March, US Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) called for an investigation into whether games like Fortnite are harming children’s mental health. The Senators claimed that the popular battle royale title could be addictive and lead to social isolation and depression.
