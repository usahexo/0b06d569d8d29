#  Why don't you answer my questions?

When you ask someone a question, you expect them to answer it. If they don't, there's usually a reason. Maybe they're busy, or maybe they don't know how to answer. But sometimes, people just don't want to answer your questions.

There are a few reasons why people might not want to answer your questions. Maybe they think you're being nosy, or maybe they think you won't understand what they're saying. But the most common reason is that they don't trust you.

People might not trust you if you've been mean to them in the past, or if they think you're going to use their answers against them. They might also not trust you if you're asking for confidential information.

If someone doesn't trust you, there's usually not much you can do about it. You can try building up that trust by being friendly and helpful, but it might take a long time for the other person to start trusting you again. In the meantime, be patient and understanding – and don't ask too many questions!
