#  When Will the New Jersey Casinos Start Sports Betting?

Since the United States Supreme Court ruled in May that individual states could legalize sports betting, there's been a lot of interest in when New Jersey's casinos might start taking sports wagers.

At the moment, it seems like it could be any day now. Some news sources are reporting that casino officials are just waiting for the green light from regulators, while others are saying that there are still some kinks to work out in terms of how the sports betting will be implemented.

No matter when it happens, though, it's clear that New Jersey is ready and eager to get into the sports betting game. The state already has a robust gambling industry, and officials believe that allowing sports betting will only add to its growth.

In fact, some estimates suggest that legalizing sports betting could generate as much as $100 million in new tax revenue for New Jersey each year. Not too bad!

There's also been a lot of speculation about which casinos will be first to offer sports betting. The most likely candidates seem to be the Borgata, Caesar's Palace, and the Golden Nugget – all of which are located in Atlantic City.

But it's still unclear exactly when they'll start taking bets – or what types of bets will be offered. So stay tuned for updates!

#  NJ Casinos Eyeing Late November for Sports Betting

The New Jersey casinos want to start sports betting before the end of November, according to a report from NorthJersey.com.

Representatives from the Borgata and Caesars Entertainment said they would like to launch sports betting in the next few weeks, while other casino representatives declined to give a specific date but acknowledged they are eyeing a late-November start.

“It’s fair to say that the majority of our group is looking at November,” said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.

Anthony Scallon, a spokesman for Caesars Entertainment, said his company was hoping for a Nov. 15 launch. The Borgata did not respond to requests for comment.

Casinos have been waiting for approval from the state Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) since Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation in June legalizing sports betting in New Jersey. The DGE has been slowed by the need to hire more staff and develop new regulations, but it is now moving forward with approvals.

Murphy has said he wants the casinos open for business as soon as possible. “My expectation is we will be up and running sooner rather than later,” he said in September.

New Jersey is one of only three states – along with Delaware and West Virginia – where sports betting is legal outside of Nevada. The Legislature passed a bill legalizing sports betting in January after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had prohibited such gambling outside of Nevada. But Atlantic City casinos were unable to offer sports betting until Murphy signed new legislation in June expanding on an earlier bill that allowed wagering on only professional football games.

#  When Will Atlantic City Casinos Get in the Sports Betting Game?

The New Jersey sports betting market is booming, and the Atlantic City casinos want in on the action.

But there’s a big roadblock in their way: the professional sports leagues, which have successfully lobbied to keep the casinos from offering sports betting.

Now, with the US Supreme Court ready to rule on a case that could overturn that ban, the Atlantic City casinos are making their final push for inclusion.

Casino executives and state lawmakers made their case at a recent hearing of the New Jersey Assembly Budget Committee, saying that the state’s 38 million annual visitors would provide a massive new customer base for sports betting.

“This is an opportunity for us to recapture some of those gaming dollars that have gone to Pennsylvania and elsewhere,” said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.

Pennsylvania legalized sports betting in 2017 and has seen a boost in tourism as a result. Since then, several other states have followed suit.

But while New Jersey is eager to get into the game, the professional sports leagues are fighting hard to keep them out. The NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL argue that gambling poses a threat to the integrity of their games.

At Monday’s budget committee hearing, attendees heard testimony from both sides of the issue. Representatives from the pro-gambling coalition called Gaming Innovation Alliance argued that legalization would create jobs and tax revenue for the state. They also noted that illegal betting already takes place in New Jersey and is not regulated by the leagues.

On the other side, representatives from the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL testified about why they believe gambling is harmful to their businesses.

“Sports betting threatens our very foundation, which is based on fans’ trust that our games are fair and reliable … we must do everything possible to protect this trust as well as our intellectual property and business interests globally,” said NBA Senior Vice President Dan Spillane.

The US Supreme Court is expected to rule on Sports Betting case Christie v NCAA by June 2019. If they overturn the ban on gambling imposed by PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), it will be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize it.

#  NJ Casinos Poised to Start Sports Betting in Time for Football Season

New Jersey casinos are counting down the days until they can start sports betting in time for football season.

According to a report from NJ.com, "Monmouth Park Racetrack plans to take its first legal sports bet at 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 1."

The Meadowlands Racetrack is also getting ready for football season, with plans to offer sports betting as soon as September 4th.

First, however, both facilities need to get approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE).

"We're hopeful that we get final approval this week and be able to take bets the first week of September," Dennis Drazin, the chairman and CEO of Monmouth Park, told NJ.com.

"We just have to dot some i's and cross some t's with the DGE," he added.

While Monmouth Park is planning to start taking bets on September 1st, the Meadowlands may have a slight head start.

According to NorthJersey.com, "the Meadowlands could begin taking bets as early as Tuesday, Sept. 4 if it gets approval from regulators on Monday."

Both tracks are expecting significant business from sports betting in the coming months and years.

#  New Jersey Casinos Planning to Start Sports Betting Soon

After the US Supreme Court struck down a ban on sports betting, it was only a matter of time before New Jersey casinos started offering it. And that time is now.

The Borgata and Ocean Resort Casino have both announced that they will start taking sports bets this week. The Borgata is starting on Thursday, while the Ocean Resort Casino is starting on Friday.

Both casinos say that they will offer a wide range of betting options, including point spreads, money lines, and over/under totals. They will also offer in-game betting for major sporting events.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has been a big supporter of legalizing sports betting, and he is excited about the prospects for the industry.

"This is about jobs and economic development," said Murphy. "It's about putting New Jersey first."

The state estimates that sports betting could generate up to $500 million in annual revenue. That would be a big boost to the state's economy.

Not everyone is happy with the decision to legalize sports betting, however. Some people argue that it could lead to increased corruption in professional sports.
