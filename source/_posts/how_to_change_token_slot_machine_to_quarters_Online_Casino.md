# How to Change Token Slot Machine to Quarters

If you are a fan of slot machines, you might come across a machine that accepts tokens instead of quarters. While tokens may be convenient to use, they are not as widely accepted as quarters, which means that you might struggle to find places to use them outside of the casino. Fortunately, you can easily convert your token slot machine to accept quarters instead. Here are the steps to follow:

## Step 1: Gather your tools and supplies

To convert your token slot machine to quarters, you will need the following tools and supplies:

- Screwdriver
- Pliers
- Electrical tape
- Quarters

## Step 2: Locate the coin mechanism

The coin mechanism is usually located on the front or side of the slot machine. It is the part of the machine that accepts and dispenses coins.

## Step 3: Remove the coin mechanism

Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the coin mechanism in place. Carefully pull the mechanism out of the machine.

## Step 4: Change the coin mechanism

Inside the coin mechanism, you will find a small plastic disk that is designed to accept tokens. Use pliers to remove this disk and replace it with a new disk that is designed to accept quarters.

## Step 5: Reinstall the coin mechanism

Carefully place the coin mechanism back into the slot machine and secure it in place with the screws you removed earlier.

## Step 6: Test the machine

Insert a quarter into the slot machine to make sure that it accepts and dispenses quarters properly. If the machine does not work as expected, you may need to adjust the coin mechanism or seek the help of a professional technician.

## Step 7: Tape over the token slot

To prevent users from accidentally inserting tokens into the machine, use electrical tape to cover up the slot where tokens used to be accepted.

By following these simple steps, you can easily convert your token slot machine to accept quarters instead. With this modification, you can enjoy playing your favorite slot machine games without the hassle of carrying tokens or searching for places that accept them.
